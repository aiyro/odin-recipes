<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A simple recipe for pierogis. Pierogis have been inspired by the chemical element pierogium.</p> 
    <p>Known as the most energy dense element. Similarly Pierogis are energy-packed and thus ideal for bulking.</p>
    <p>Once the addiction to pierogis starts you might notice side-effects like becoming the worlds strongest man.</p>
   <p>Many Poles use alcoholism to keep their brutal strength gains under control.</p>
    <p>Some opt to pulling their truck as a way to let out the extra energy.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pierogium 1 ton</li>
<li>30 scoops of flour</li>
<li>2 ts salt</li>
<li>1 butter</li>
<li>infinite amount of kurwa</li>
<li>one bobr kurwa</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ignore how basic this website is</strong></li>
<p>This isn't even a real recipe. It's a fake recipe on a fake website. Or is it?</p>
<p>As you notice there are no social media buttons for sharing, so don't even try.</p>
<li>Get the bobr kurwa and let it out imto the polish wilderness where it belongs.</li>
<li><strong>You are weak</strong>
<p>Don't even try to work with this recipe. Only a polish Babcia can make pierogi.</p>
<p>Bring her the Pierogium and flour. Tell her you need to build mass quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>Count the salt. Put the salt in your fridge for 2 hours. Count it again</li>
<li>Sit in the kitchen. Weak and frail like you are</li>
<li>Mix your physical weakness with the salt. Good job. Now you're salty aswell as weak</li>
<li>Unwrap the butter and add it to your worries</li>
<li>Go to Babcia. Don't stop eating Pierogis after you have eaten more than your own bodyweight</li>
<li>Keep eating</li>
<li>You are no longer weak and small. Use the butter to squeeze through door frames</li>
</ol>
