<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tasty Air Pizza by former baseball player Michael Jordan</p>
<p>This pizza isn't like any other pizza.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 pair of Air Jordans</li>
<li>1 tsp sugar</li>
<li>1 packet (2 ¼ tsp) of active dry yeast</li>
<li>2 tsp salt </li>
<li>1 ½ cups warm water (not too hot, just like Jordan's shooting streak)</li>
<li>2 tbsp olive oil (for smoothness, like MJ's moves on the court)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water. Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let it sit for about 5 minutes</li>
<li>To the yeast mixture, add the olive oil, salt, and gradually start adding flour, one cup at a time, until a dough starts to form. </li>
<li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it with your hands for about 10 minutes</li>
<li>Cover it with a clean towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour</li>
<li>Shape the dough into a ball, then roll it out into your desired pizza shape on a floured surface</li>
<li>Give the dough a quick pre-bake (about 3-5 minutes) to firm up slightly</li>
<li>Remove the dough from the oven, add your pair of Air Jordans, and bake for another 10-15 minutes</li>
</ol>
